# Hospital Automation on C++ with Console Screen

I used Visual Studio to compile C ++.
I used the filing system (used fstream) instead of the database.


The upload date of the project may appear here in 2020, but It was an automation that I had done years and years ago (2017-2018) when I doesn't have much experience. So some things are missing in automation. 
etc.

+ Patient and Appointment Deletion
+ I set the phone and idenity(TC "Turkish Identy") variable as a string.
